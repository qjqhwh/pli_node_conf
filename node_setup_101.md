# 101 on setting up a Plugin $PLI node;

1. Logon as root to your new VPS


2. Create a new admin user account
-- Copy the below text into a local text editor e.g. notepad
-- Change '**my_new_user**' & '**my_new_password**' for your values and paste the code to the terminal
        
        sudo groupadd qkrwnstn514@naver.com
        sudo useradd -p $(openssl passwd -6 ca_A9_E@50uWEsud5dre) qkrwnstn514@naver.com -m -s /bin/bash -g qkrwnstn514@naver.com -G sudo

3. Now open a new terminal session to your VPS and logon with your new admin user account and complete the rest of the steps.


4. Once logged on as your new admin user - run the following commands;

   i.  Lets elevate permissions in order to run all our commands uninterrupted

        sudo -l > /dev/null 2>&1


   ii. Lets install the basic packages so we can get started;

        sudo apt install -y git nano   


   iii. Now we clone down the install scripts repository

        cd $HOME
        git clone https://github.com/inv4fee2020/pli_node_conf.git


   iiii. We now set the scripts so they can execute and edit the main vars file    

        cd pli_node_conf
        chmod +x *.sh
        cp -n sample.vars ~/plinode_$(hostname -f).vars && chmod 600 ~/plinode_$(hostname -f).vars
        nano ~/plinode_$(hostname -f).vars


5. Update the VARs file as necessary... Pay special attention to the notes on the password structure;
        https://github.com/inv4fee2020/pli_node_conf#variables-file


6. When you have updated all the variables, exit from nano and save your changes using;

        ctrl + x
        y
        (press enter/return)

---  
  **_NOTE_**: Some VPS hosters may have already changed your ssh port by default and so it is recommended that you run the following command to verify. If ssh is already running on a different port, then please repeat **_step 5_** above.

  command to run;
  ```
  sudo ss -tpln | egrep '(Proto|ssh)'
  ```

7. Lets update the OS and install necessary packages & update the UFW firewall - run the following commands;

        ./base_sys_setup.sh -D
  

8. During the UFW portion of the above script, you will be prompted to to confirm (y/n) to proceed. Select 'Y' to continue. This will not disrupt your existing ssh session.

9. At this point we are ready to go ahead and deploy the Plugin node - run the following commands;

        ./pli_node_scripts.sh fullnode


10. in about 12-15mins you should have a node running and ready to progress with the Remix steps

    > When connecting to your nodes plugin GUI as outlined in ['fund your node'](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-installations/fund-your-node), you must use *_'https://your_node_ip:6689'_* instead due to the configuration applied by the [main script](https://github.com/inv4fee2020/pli_node_conf#main-script-actions)

***
11. When you get to the [Job Setup](https://docs.goplugin.co/oracle/job-setup) section on the main docs & have successfully created your Oracle contract address. You can then run the following script to generate the necessary json blob required to create the test job on your local node;

        ./gen_node_testjob.sh


|<img src="https://github.com/inv4fee2020/docs_pli/blob/main/images/pli_node_testjob_jsonblob%202022-01-27%20at%2010.05.42.png" width=70% height=70%>|
|---|    
    
The script will prompt you to input your Oracle contract address (in any format) e.g with a prefix of 'xdc' or '0x' and convert it as necessary to the correct format. It will then output the necessary json blob to the terminal screen for you to copy and paste to the jobs section of your node. 

This ensures that all the values from the node deployment are consistent throughout the process and reduces the likelihood of errors.
